  This spider diagram compares three computational chemistry methods: Classical Force Fields, Foundational ML Force Fields, and Density Functional Theory (DFT). The comparison is based on three key attributes:

  1. Accuracy: The precision and reliability of the method's predictions.
  2. Speed: The computational efficiency and time required for simulations.
  3. Generalizability: The ability to be applied across diverse chemical systems and material classes.

  - Classical Force Fields (red): Highest speed, medium accuracy, lowest generalizability.
  - DFT (green): Highest accuracy and generalizability, but lowest speed.
  - Foundational ML Force Fields (blue): Balanced performance across all attributes, positioned between classical methods and DFT.

  This diagram shows common trade-offs, highlighting how Foundational ML Force Fields aim to bridge the gap between the speed of classical methods and the accuracy of DFT, while offering improved generalizability over classical force fields.
