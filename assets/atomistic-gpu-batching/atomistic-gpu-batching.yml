  Comparison of three strategies for running multiple atomistic simulations on GPUs:
  1. Unbatched - Sequential execution with minimal GPU utilization (0-5%)
  2. Binned Auto-Batcher - Fixed-size batches improve GPU utilization (40-60%) but waste resources as structures complete
  3. In-Flight Auto-Batcher - Dynamic reallocation eliminates GPU idle time by immediately swapping in new structures when others complete, maintaining high GPU utilization (80-90%)

  Key points:
  - GPU resources are wasted when not fully utilized by a single simulation
  - Fixed batching improves utilization but suffers as structures complete at different rates
  - Dynamic in-flight batching maximizes GPU utilization by maintaining a full batch at all times
  - The overall time to process all structures is significantly reduced with in-flight batching
  - Effective GPU utilization leads to higher throughput and energy efficiency
