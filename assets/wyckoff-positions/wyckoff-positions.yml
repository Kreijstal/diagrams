  Unit cell representation of a 2D crystal with p4m symmetry and three occupied Wyckoff positions.
  The shaded areas highlight the asymmetric unit and the site-symmetries of the atoms, indicating the region of the unit cell the each atom is constrained to lie in by specifying tis anonymized Wyckoff position. Reproduced from fig. 1 in ["Wyckoff Set Regression for Materials Discovery"](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2020/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2020_21.pdf) by Rhys Goodall, inspired by [PyXtal docs](https://pyxtal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Background.html#wyckoff-positions).
